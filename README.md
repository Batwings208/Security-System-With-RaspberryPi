# Security-System-With-RaspberryPi
This is a Home Security Project. Designed as a low-budget option but also upgradable with ease. Made over the duration of 1-2 months (due to lack of parts). Made for testing personal abilities and developing knowledge on the interaction between hardware and software. Used Python 3.9.5 for this project but planning in the future to possibly change to an alternate language for more speed and be able to add more functionality. The total cost of the entire build was kept under $100. A suggestion I would add for one doing a similar project is to use a more recent Raspberry Pi as booting takes a long time and its capabilites are limited. Initially planned to add FaceID (Code Complete) but I felt that would be too much for the Raspberry Pi to deal with. Currently thinking for options for FaceID.


# Components/Hardware
**Listed Version**
1. Raspberry Pi Model B+ (521MB)
2. Two 5V Rely Switch (only needed/used one)
3. 3.5 inch LCD Screen
4. DC 12V Power Supply (Solenoid)
5. Female Connector (Used for CCTV cameras, etc.)
6. Fielect DV 12V Pull Type Solenoid Electromagnet (open-framed)
7. Tenda W311m 150 Mbps Mini Wireless USB Adapter
8. GPIO Expansion Board
9. DC 5V Power Supply (Raspberry Pi Model B+)
10. Dupont Cables **MM-MM, FF-FF, MM-FF** incase (around 5 of each)


The project runs on a **Raspberry Pi Model B+ (512MB)**. Due to the lack of power, the project was adjusted for effiency and effective power usage to prevent overheating. The average temperature of the system sat around **40-42 CÂº** being overclocked at **high** by RaspberryPi's own overclock tool. The load on the CPU while running stayed at a bare minimum below **5%**.

RaspberryPi connected to a 3.5inch LCD screen and 5V Rely Switch connected to solenoid and power supply of solenoid.
